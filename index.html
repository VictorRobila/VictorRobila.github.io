        The goal of Computer Science Chats is to facilitate conversations about computing and computer science designed for a high school audience. We interview computing professionals on their career paths and their advice for students. Our hope is that high school students will be able to learn through this resource and be inspired to pursue their computing dreams and see the different careers in computing and computer science and what they entail in terms of research, activities, and knowledge. All our video interviews are posted on the cschats.org website and the cschats YouTube channel to create easy access to any of our materials.

     Computer Science Chats (cschats) was created by Victor Robila, a student at Hunter College High School in New York City. Having discovered programming through Scratch in elementary school, Victor has grown his passion for computer science through learning new languages such as Python, and C, developing webpages and working on research projects with fellow students and faculty.
<br>
<br>
     As a high schooler, Victor wants to help other students appreciate the role computing has in our lives and understand how they can pursue a career in computing. There are many questions one may have such as: "What are the fundamental skills needed to be successful in a computer career?", "How do people discover their appreciation of computers?", "How will computers look like in the future?", and "What new problems will they solve?". When trying to find answers to these questions he believes that a good approach is to ask computer professionals. For this reason, he has started cschats, a series of short chats with people from diverse backgrounds that through their studies and work have demonstrated a strong passion for computing.
